              Welcome to Treasured Care For You – a place where care goes beyond
              the task, and every individual is seen, heard, and supported with
              dignity.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              My name is Adelaide Mosley, and it's both an honour and a
              privilege to serve as the Director of Treasured Care For You. With
              a long-standing career in nursing and years of hands-on experience
              as both a Registered Nurse and a support worker, I've witnessed
              firsthand the difference that genuine, person-centred care can
              make in someone's life.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              This organisation was built from the ground up with a deep
              understanding of what quality suppoprt truly looks like - not just
              from a clinical perspective, but from a human one. We are here not
              just to provide services, but to build trusted relationships,
              foster independence, and create an environment where every
              indivual feels safe repected, and empowered.
            </p>

              Whether you're with us through the NDIS or seeking aged care
              support, know that you are at the heart of everything we do. Our
              dedicated team shares my passion and commitment to compassionate,
